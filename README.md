# com.lefevreservices.androidhelloworld (aka Android Hello World)
My FIRST Android app! It shows Hello world. Made in 2014, using Eclipse.

I used the tips given by a free online MOOC from OpenClassrooms, to code it. The MOOC no longer exists, but they have other ones about Android development.

This code is provided AS-IS, and without any license. I won't modify it.
(seriously, I just wanted to free up space on my hard drive, that's why I uploaded it ðŸ˜‚)
