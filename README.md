# com.lefevreservices.androidhelloworld (aka Android Hello World)
My FIRST Android app! It shows Hello world. Made in 2014, using Eclipse ADT on Windows.

I used the tips given by a free online MOOC from OpenClassrooms, to code it. The MOOC no longer exists, but they have other ones about Android development.

This code is provided AS-IS, and without any license. I won't modify it.
(seriously, I just wanted to free up space on my hard drive, that's why I uploaded it ðŸ˜‚)

## License
I coded everything myself, this project contains no restricted content.
The logo was made with GIMP (source file: https://github.com/fanfan54/com.lefevreservices.androidhelloworld/raw/master/productIcon-xxhdpi.xcf) , I forgot where the emoji design came from, I think it was from a font like Segoe UI but I'm not sure.

I decided to release the code in the public domain.
